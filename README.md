# Green-Wall-Project-Offset-Prediction-Model
Repository with prediction model for calculating correction offsets for pin-to-pin movements of spider's legs.

The module contains code for OffsetPredictor class (see the example usage in the [offset_predictor.py](gwpoffpm/offset_predictor.py) file). For the sake of completeness we also provide training and evaluation code.

The trained model can be downloaded from [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiOQtuyfuo5UnOdaQwali85htwE09w?e=VNfLjW).
